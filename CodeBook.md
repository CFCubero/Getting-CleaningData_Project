## The tidy_dataset.txt file is based on the following columns separated by space characters:

* Dimensions:

activity_id		--> number that identifies the kind of activity
activity_name		--> literal that identifies the kind of activity
subject_id		--> number that identifies the user that performed the activity (from 1 to 30)

* Measurements:

##  The above mentioned activities can be one of the following six:

id name

1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING


##  The above mentioned measurements are calculated as the mean for each user and activity of all related fields obtained from the dataset published in the following source:

##  In order to obtain a quick view of the content of each measurement based on the name of the column, it is easy knowing that this name is related to the kind of sensor and the agregation method of the measurements:

Sensor (XYZ is one of the space dimensions):

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

* Aggregation method:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
